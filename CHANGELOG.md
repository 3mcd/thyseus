# Changelog

## v0.6.0 (November 18, 2022)

Structs just got a lot more powerful!

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   The `store` and `index` properties on `ComponentType` instances have been
    renamed, freeing up store and index as useable field names.
    -   This change does not impact you unless you directly access either of
        those properties.
    -   The new names are `__$$s` for store,`__$$i` for index, and `__$$b` for
        the new byteOffset property (these may move to symbols in the future).
        -   If you write your own accessors, you must use byte offset if you
            want your struct to function with `@struct.substruct()`
-   `entityIndex` on `Entity` has been changed to `index`.
-   Static properties for struct classes have changed.
    -   This change does not impact you unless you have handwritten Components -
        i.e., without use of `@struct`.
    -   `alignment` - the number of bytes needed by the largest field of the
        struct (e.g. 8 for `f64`, `i64`, `u64`, 4 for `f32`, `i32`, `u32`,
        etc.).
        -   Array/string alignment is the same as individual field alignment
            (e.g., an `i32` and an `Int32Array` have the same alignment).
    -   `size` - the size of the type _including padding_ (previously did not
        include padding). **Must be a multiple of alignment.**
    -   `schema` - a **_numeric_** (bitfield) property indicating which
        TypedArrays are needed when creating a store.
        -   Bit flags start with `u8 = 1 << 0`, and are ordered
            `u8 ... u64, i8 ... i64, f32, f64`.
-   The shape & memory layout of component stores has changed.
    -   This change does not impact you unless you directly access component
        store data (like `world.archetypes`) or have handwritten accessors on
        components.
    -   Previously, component stores would allocate a buffer and each field
        would claim a section of the buffer (e.g. `|x---|y---|z---|` for a store
        of `Vec3` components). Now, components are placed sequentially in the
        buffer (e.g., `|xyz|xyz|xyz|`).
        -   Stores are now objects containing the `buffer`, a Uint8Array (`u8`)
            over the (entire) buffer, and any other typed arrays specified by a
            struct's `schema` over the entire buffer.
    -   Benchmarks suggested this was a significantly more performant approach -
        _both_ for iteration and for copying component data such as growing
        stores, moving tables, and (in the future) setting initial values.
    -   Please note that if you do access component data directly, fields are
        reordered as necessary (by alignment, largest to smallest, equal
        alignments appended), and so may or may not be in the same order as
        declared.

### ‚ú® Features

-   Added `@struct.string()` for fixed-size strings.
    -   This decorator factory accepts an options object, containing either:
        -   `characterCount: number` allocates _enough space for `n`
            **three-byte** characters_ - if any characters use fewer than three
            bytes, more characters will be able to fit.
        -   `byteLength` specifies how many bytes the string takes up. If you
            know you'll only be using one or two byte characters, you can reduce
            the required storage space of the string.
        -   byteLength is used if both are set.
    -   Unlike normal Javascript strings, `'\u0000'` characters terminate the
        string.
    -   Please note that the current implementation uses dynamic typed array
        creation, and so is much slower than primitive numeric fields.
-   Added `@struct.array()` for fixed-size numeric arrays.
    -   This decorator factory accepts an options argument with two required
        fields:
        -   `type` - The name of the array type (e.g. `'u8'`, `'i16'`, `'f64'`,
            etc.)
        -   `length` - The length (in elements) of the array.
    -   Please note that the current implementation uses dynamic typed array
        creation, and so is much slower than primitive numeric fields.
-   Added `@struct.substruct()`, so structs can have _other structs_ as
    properties.
    -   This decorator factory accepts a struct.
    -   Creates both a getter and a setter.
    -   The current implementation dynamically creates instances of the provided
        struct, and so is much slower than primitive numeric fields. In the
        future this will be refactored to take advantage of a per-thread
        struct-instance pool.
-   It is no longer required that `getNewTableSize` return multiples of 8.
    -   As a result, resources create a store of size 1, rather than using
        `getNewTableSize(0)`

### üêõ Bug Fixes

-   Fixed issue where table stores wouldn't re-pack data correctly when moving
    to tables with fewer components.
-   Fixed a bug where new components would initialize with old component data.
    -   The current implementation eagerly zeroes data when components move -
        this will likely be done lazily in the future, so if you manually access
        component data, do not rely on eager zeroing.
-   Fixed tables not correctly sharing metadata between threads.
-   Prevent columns from being created for ZSTs in tables.

### üîß Maintenance

-   Cleanup type names (`ComponentType` -> `Struct`)
-   Bumped dev dependency versions.

## v0.5.0 (October 29, 2022)

This update is heavy on breaking changes and light on features - primarily
focused on internal cleanup & moving forward with a better API. Exciting feature
work coming soon!

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   Removed `Component()` function and `Type` enum - replaced with `@struct()`
    decorator (check the [README](./README.md) for updated API reference).
    -   The primary motivation for this change was that, for this use case,
        decorators:
        -   Better demonstrate intent
        -   Have clearer fields at a glance
        -   Allow components to be declared without extending a class
        -   Are more flexible for future features
    -   Additionally, thyseus will eventually have an optional TS compiler to
        provide better performance & DX, and decorators will likely be easier to
        work with for this.
    -   Unfortunately, current Typescript decorators do not provide outstanding
        type information. The current implementation will be updated to the new
        decorators proposal once Typescript adds support, which will hopefully
        provide better type info.
-   Removed `ThreadProtocol`, `Resource()` function (resources should be
    declared with `@struct()` like components)
    -   This was primarily to unify around a single model of shared data.
    -   Additionally, ThreadProtocol had some less than ideal performance
        characteristics that impacted all values sent across thread boundaries.
        Without it, transfering data across threads should be much faster.
-   Static `create()` methods on Resources will not be called anymore. See
    features for the replacement API, which allows async initialization and
    access to private class members.
-   The first argument of `defineSystem()` is now a function that is passed an
    object containing descriptors (`P`) as well as `Mut`.
    -   This reduces the amount of top-level API, and marks a step towards
        making the TS compiler mentioned above easier to build.
-   Removed `P`, `Mut` exports, moved `World` from default to named export.

### ‚ú® Features

-   Resources with an `initialize(world: World): void | Promise<void>` method
    (**not** static) will have that method called immediately after the world is
    created (before the `WorldBuilder.build()` promise resolves).
    -   `initialize` is only called on the main thread, so context-sensitive
        operations like setting up event listeners can be done here.
-   Add `registerThreadChannel()` method to `WorldBuilder`.
    -   Pass a channel name (`string`) and a handler _creator_
        (`(world: World) => (data: SendableType) => SendableType`).
    -   Channels must be **unique** - one channel may only have one handler.
-   Nearly all properties on `World` and `WorldBuilder` are public now.
    -   While mutating World properties directly is rarely a good idea, not
        letting users access World internals seemed like a worse idea.
-   Component fields can be booleans with `@struct.bool()`.
    -   At the moment, this is just a wrapper around `@struct.u8()`, so bool
        fields require an entire byte (may be reworked in the future).
-   The internal `Executor` for systems has been slightly rewritten and no
    longer users `Atomics.waitAsync`.
    -   This marks multithreading capabilities on all browsers that support
        `SharedArrayBuffer` and module Workers, and no longer requires
        `SharedArrayBuffer` when singlethreaded! üéâ
    -   In a near update, Worlds will accept custom executors, so while the
        default Executor will always aim to work in (nearly) all runtimes out of
        the box, if `Atomics.waitAsync`/`Atomics.wait`/another approach is
        better for your use case, a custom implementation could be swapped in.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

-   Fixed promises returned by systems not being awaited by the executor.
-   Fixed tables not retaining new columns after grow.

### üîß Maintenance

-   Bumped dev dependency versions.

## v0.4.0 (October 22, 2022)

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   Some elements of `WorldBuilder` and `World` have changed.
    -   `components` on World is now a `ComponentType[]`.
    -   `queries` on **World** is now a `Query[]`.
    -   `queries` and `registerQuery` on **WorldBuilder** have been removed. At
        the moment, queries do not need to be pre-registered.
-   Some properties previously available on `WorldCommands` no longer exist. All
    methods remain the same.
    -   It is _strongly suggested_ that you do not access properties on
        `WorldCommands` and only use its methods, as the internal implementation
        of `WorldCommands` is likely to continue to change (pre-1.0).
-   Some properties previously available on `Query` no longer exist. Iteration
    remains the same.
    -   Namely, queries no longer need to track which entities match them, and
        so have no `entities` field.
    -   As above, it is strongly suggested that you simply iterate over query
        instances, as the rest of the properties are subject to change.
-   `threads` on `World` have been changed from `Thread[]` to `ThreadGroup`.
    -   Some of the functionality of ThreadGroup will be expanded to be
        consumer-facing in a future update.

### ‚ú® Features

-   Now uses
    [archetypes](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq#archetypes-aka-dense-ecs-or-table-based-ecs)
    for component storage! As a result, **_memory usage is significantly
    reduced_**, and iterating queries should be more cache-friendly.
    -   Archetypes can be accessed with `world.archetypes`
        (`Map<bigint, Table>`).
    -   Bear in mind that archetypes may be somewhat slower at the moment than
        the previous storage mechanism - especially adding/removing Components -
        but have the potential to be much faster - more benchmarking around the
        bottlenecks of the current implementation is needed, first.
-   Entities are now a _generational_ index.
    -   Every entity has an associated generation. Whenever an entity is
        despawned, the generation is incremented.
    -   Entity data can be queried for with the `Entity` component (all living
        entities have this component, so it does not affect what a query
        matches).
    -   The `Entity` component has no setters and includes a few methods that
        can be used to queue components for add/remove, or to despawn the
        entity - `WorldCommands.spawn()` returns an Entity component! These
        methods do not require a lock, and so **_Entity can (and should) be
        accessed immutably_**.
        ```ts
        class Entity {
        	get id(): bigint; // uint64
        	get generation(): number; // uint32
        	get entityIndex(): number; // uint32
        	insert(Component: ComponentType<any>): this;
        	remove(Component: ComponentType): this;
        	despawn(): void;
        }
        ```
-   Added `getNewTableSize: (prev: number) => number` to world config, which
    determines how archetype tables grow. By default, 8 entities are allocated
    for a table, and table size is doubled each grow.
    -   When creating a new table, the `prev` argument will be 0.
    -   _Returned values **must** be multiples of 8_ - failure to do so will
        result in undefined behavior!
-   Systems can now return promises, which will be `await`ed before continuing
    system execution on that thread. This should not be utilized often, as any
    data a system locks will remain locked until the promise is resolved!

### üîß Maintenance

-   Bumped dev dependency versions.

## v0.3.0 (September 11, 2022)

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   Single-threaded worlds use the same executor as multithreaded worlds. As a
    result, they will respect passed dependencies. Unfortunately, they now
    require `Atomics.waitAsync` - this will be resolved in a future release.
-   Components can no longer be used as Resources (i.e.,
    `class MyResource extends Component({ ... }) {}` no longer works as
    expected). The `Resource()` function is now provided to serve this purpose.
    `Resource()` is nearly identical to `Component()`, but requires a schema.
-   `EntityManager` has been replaced with `WorldCommands` - see below for
    details. Systems using `P.Entities()` must be updated to `P.Commands()` and
    the new Commands API.
-   The `Thread` class is no longer exposed (not intended for consumer use). To
    access the `Send` and `Receive` symbols, you can instead
    `import { ThreadProtocol } from 'thyseus'`.

### ‚ú® Features

-   New `Commands` API!
    -   Commands can be accessed on any thread, and is disjoint with all other
        parameters - **_including itself_**.
    -   Commands functionally queues modifications to entities - updates to
        queries occurs in a system that intersects with all other systems. If
        you need systems to run _after_ entity modification, you can
        `import { applyCommands } from 'thyseus'` and specify it as a
        dependency. Be aware that for multithreaded worlds, doing so will create
        a hard sync point. Last, WorldBuilders always add the `applyCommands`
        system - you don't need to add it yourself.
-   New minimal plugin API!
    -   Plugins are just functions that accept a WorldBuilder instance. They can
        add systems to the world just as normal, and are useful for creating
        shared groups of systems that may depend on eachother.
    -   Add plugins to a world with the `addPlugin` method.
    -   The `definePlugin` function is provided for type help.
-   New `World` system parameter.
    -   This provides direct access to the World and all of its data. It
        intersects with all other system parameters (creating a sync point for
        multithreaded worlds). Systems that access `World` always run on the
        main thread, and can therefore access main-thread-only resources if
        needed.
-   New methods for `WorldBuilder`, and some previously internal properties on
    `World` and `WorldBuilder` are exposed thru getters! Most of these are
    designed for internal use, but could be useful for advanced use cases.
    -   As a result of this and other refactors, user-defined system parameter
        descriptors are now possible. This is a more advanced pattern, and more
        documentation around this will be available in the future.

### üîß Maintenance

-   Improved annotations on classes/methods.
-   Cleaned up type names - Component Classes are now `ComponentType`, Resource
    Classes are now `ResourceType`.
-   Major behind-the-scenes refactoring. Overall package size has been reduced!
-   Improved test coverage.
-   Bumped dev dependency versions.

## v0.2.0 (July 31, 2022)

### üí• Breaking Changes

-   `defineSystem()` now returns an object rather adding a `parameters` property
    to the provided function. As a result, the same function can be re-used for
    multiple systems.

### ‚ú® Features

-   You can now specify dependencies between systems to force a specific
    execution order! The `addSystem()` method now accepts an optional second
    argument, which can be used to specify if a system must execute before/after
    other systems.

    ```ts
    const updateTime = defineSystem(/* ... */);
    const handleInput = defineSystem(/* ... */);
    const mover = defineSystem(/* ... */);
    const draw = defineSystem(/* ... */);

    const myWorld = World.new()
    	// Mover will not run until after handleInput has finished.
    	.addSystem(mover, { after: [handleInput] })
    	// A matching before/after pair is permitted but not required.
    	.addSystem(handleInput)
    	// draw will not run until all intersecting systems have finished.
    	.addSystem(draw, { afterAll: true })
    	// updateTime must run before any intersecting systems may run.
    	.addSystem(updateTime, { beforeAll: true });

    // Dependencies look like this:
    interface Dependencies {
    	before?: SystemDefinition[];
    	after?: SystemDefinition[];
    	beforeAll?: boolean;
    	afterAll?: boolean;
    }
    ```

    A few notes on dependencies:

    -   Both explicit (`before`, `after`) and implicit (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`)
        dependencies apply only to systems that intersect. For example, if
        systems `A` and `B` are disjoint, then `A before B` will have no effect.
        Similarly, `A beforeAll` _will **not**_ guarantee that `A` runs before
        `B` (but will guarantee that `A` runs before any other systems that `A`
        intersects with).
    -   Explicit dependencies take precedence over implicit dependencies. Given
        intersecting `A` and `B`, `(B beforeAll), (A before B)` will guarantee
        that A runs before B.
    -   If no explicit resolution is provided, implicit dependencies are
        evaluated _in the order they are passed in_.
        -   Given `(A beforeAll), (B beforeAll)`, `A` will be guaranteed to
            execute before `B`.
        -   Given `(A afterAll), (B afterAll)`, `A` will be guaranteed to
            execute _after_ `B`.
    -   Directly contradictory dependencies - such as `A after A` or
        `(A before B), (B before A)` - will cause an error to be thrown when the
        world is built.
    -   Dependencies apply only to multithreaded worlds for the moment. In the
        future, single threaded worlds will also use dependencies.

-   Resources can now also be made thread-friendly by implementing Thyseus's
    internal Thread Send/Receive protocol (i.e., classes that implement
    `static [Thread.Receive]() {}` and `[Thread.Send]() {}` methods).
    -   Constructors for classes implementing `Send`/`Receive` will be called
        with the world config.
    -   This is the recommended method of defining resources.
-   Resources that are bound to the main thread for initialization, but are
    readable and/or writeable from multiple threads (for example, a `Keyboard`
    resource that needs to register listeners for `keydown`/`keyup` events) can
    implement a static `create()` method that will be used rather than its
    constructor. This method receives the same arguments its constructor would
    be called with (`WorldConfig` for resources implementing Thread protocol, a
    store & index for Component-based resources), and must return an instance of
    the class.

### üîß Maintenance

-   Improved test coverage.
-   Bump Vite/Vitest version.
-   Use vite library mode to build.

## v0.1.0 (July 2, 2022)

-   Initial release.
