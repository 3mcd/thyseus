# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Thyseus! Please review this
document and the Code of Conduct before submitting any pull requests.

## Pull Requests

_**Please - ask first before starting any work.**_ As Thyseus is currently
pre-1.0 release, there are frequently commits & PRs with substantial diffs, and
branches with this code may not be visible to you. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to ping me or create an issue and I'll respond as soon as I'm able to.

## Coding Guidelines

-   PRs that introduce potentially unsafe code (e.g., uses of eval) - _no matter
    how significant the performance gains may be_ - will be rejected.
-   PRs should be formatted using prettier - prettier config is included in the
    project root.
-   PRs that include tests are significantly more likely to be merged quickly :)
